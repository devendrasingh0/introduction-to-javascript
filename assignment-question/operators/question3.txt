Differentiation of Unary, Binary, and Ternary Operators in Javascript:

1. Unary Operators:

Number of Operands: Takes one operand.

Functionality: Perform operations on a single value, such as negation, increment/decrement, logical NOT, and type conversion.

Examples:
-5 (negates 5)
++x (increments x by 1)
!true (logical NOT of true)
typeof 10 (returns the type of 10, which is "number")

2. Binary Operators:

Number of Operands: Takes two operands.

Functionality: Perform operations on two values, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, and logical operations.

Examples:
2 + 3 (addition)
5 > 3 (comparison)
x === y (strict comparison)
true && false (logical AND)

3. Ternary Operator:

Number of Operands: Takes three operands.

Functionality: Selects a value based on a condition.

Example:
age >= 18 ? "adult" : "child" (returns "adult" if age is greater than or equal to 18, else returns "child")
