Precedence and Associativity of Operators in Javascript
Understanding the precedence and associativity of operators is crucial in JavaScript for writing clear and unambiguous code. Here's a breakdown of these concepts:

1. Operator Precedence:

Defines the order in which operations are performed in an expression containing multiple operators.
Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.
JavaScript uses a fixed precedence table to determine the order of evaluation.
Example:

2 + 3 * 4

In this expression, multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so it will be evaluated first:

2 + (3 * 4)

The final result is 14.

2. Associativity:

When multiple operators have the same precedence, associativity determines the order in which they are grouped and evaluated.
JavaScript uses left-to-right associativity for most of its operators.
This means that operations are performed from left to right when they have the same precedence.

Example:

5 + 3 - 2

Both addition and subtraction have the same precedence. Since JavaScript uses left-to-right associativity, the expression is evaluated as follows:

(5 + 3) - 2

The final result is 6.

Why Understanding Precedence and Associativity is Important:

Clarity and Unambiguity: 
Clear understanding prevents unexpected behavior and ensures your code works as intended.

Debugging: 
Analyzing precedence issues helps you identify and fix errors arising from incorrect evaluation order.

Efficiency: 
Optimizing code by utilizing precedence and associativity can improve performance.

Advanced Techniques: 
Understanding these concepts is essential for using advanced techniques like short-circuiting and conditional expressions.
