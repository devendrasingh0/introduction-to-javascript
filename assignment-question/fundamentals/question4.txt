Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript
In JavaScript, declaring variables is crucial for several reasons:

Organizing your code: 
Variables provide names for data, making your code more readable and easier to maintain.

Scoping data: 
Variables define the scope of their values, ensuring that data is accessible only where intended.

Preventing errors: 
Declaring variables helps prevent typos and avoid accidental re-assignment of values.

Improved performance: 
By optimizing memory usage, variable declarations can improve the performance of your code.
Declaring Variables with let
The let keyword is a modern way to declare variables in JavaScript. Here's how it works:

JavaScript
let name = "John Doe"; // Declares a variable named "name" and assigns the value "John Doe"
let age = 30; // Declares another variable named "age" and assigns the value 30

The let keyword has the following properties:

Block-scoped: Variables declared with let are only accessible within the block they are declared in. This prevents them from accidentally being accessed or modified from outside their intended scope.

Re-assignable: You can reassign new values to variables declared with let after they have been initialized.

Hoisting: Unlike the var keyword, variables declared with let are not hoisted. This means they are not accessible before their declaration.
Here are some examples of how to use let in different contexts:

Declaring multiple variables:

JavaScript
let name = "John", age = 30, city = "New York";

Declaring variables in a loop:
JavaScript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

Conditional assignment:
JavaScript
let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

By using let for variable declarations, you can write cleaner, more organized, and safer JavaScript code.
