Importance of Comments in JavaScript
Comments in JavaScript are crucial for several reasons:

1. Code Readability:

Comments explain what the code is doing, making it easier for you and other developers to understand your code, especially when revisiting it later.
Improved code clarity can facilitate collaboration and troubleshooting.

2. Documentation:

Comments serve as internal documentation, providing information about specific functions, algorithms, or complex code blocks.
This documentation can be valuable for future developers who need to understand your code.

3. Code Maintenance:

Comments can explain the rationale behind specific code decisions, making it easier to modify and update the code in the future.
Clear comments can prevent unnecessary time spent trying to understand the logic behind the code.

4. Debugging:

Comments can help you track down bugs by adding notes about expected behavior and observations.
By providing context, comments can make debugging a more efficient process.

Examples of Comments:

Single-line comments:

Use // to comment out a single line of code.
JavaScript
// This function calculates the area of a rectangle
function calculateArea(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

Multi-line comments:

Use /* */ to comment out multiple lines of code.
JavaScript
/*
 * This loop iterates through an array and prints each element
 * to the console.
 */
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
