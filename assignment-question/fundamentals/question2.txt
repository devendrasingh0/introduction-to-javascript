Key Differences between JavaScript and HTML:

1. Purpose:

HTML: 
Defines the structure and content of a web page. It tells the browser what content to display and how to structure it.
JavaScript: 
Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows you to manipulate content and react to user actions.

2. Type:

HTML: 
Markup language: Uses tags to define the structure and elements of a web page.
JavaScript: 
Scripting language: Uses code to define instructions and logic for dynamic behavior.

3. Execution:

HTML: 
Interpreted directly by the browser.
JavaScript: 
Requires a built-in JavaScript engine in the browser to execute the code.

4. Nature of content:

HTML: 
Primarily static content that remains unchanged.
JavaScript: 
Can manipulate content to be dynamic and change in real-time.

Example situations for each:

Using HTML:

Creating a basic web page with headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
Defining the layout of a web page using sections, divs, and other structural elements.
Embedding multimedia content like images, videos, and audio.

Using JavaScript:

Adding interactive elements like buttons, forms, and menus.
Validating user input in forms.
Creating animations and other visual effects.
Building dynamic web applications with complex functionality.

Example: Interactive Button with JavaScript:

HTML
<button onclick="alert('You clicked the button!')">Click me!</button>

This code snippet creates a button with HTML, and when clicked, it displays an alert message using JavaScript.

Example: Image Gallery with JavaScript:

HTML

<div id="image-gallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
</div>

This code snippet creates a simple image gallery with HTML. JavaScript can be used to add functionality like:

Showing different images based on user interaction.
Creating a slideshow effect.
Adding navigation buttons to move between images
